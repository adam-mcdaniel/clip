A command line parser that doesn't use std or alloc!

## Why?

I mainly did this for educational purposes. I've never written a library that did not use the `std` or `alloc` crates, so I wanted to learn how.

I also think the portability of this crate will be useful in implementing [Rusty-CI](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/rusty-ci)
